## Professional Summary
I am a math and data enthusiast looking for a position where I can build probabilistic models of complex data in order to inform decision making (with a little bit of help from generative AI).
In my most recent job, I learned the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process using a variety of methods. I also have experience creating dashboards and KPIs using Tableau and Excel. I believe these experiences uniquely position me to own the data modeling process from end-to-end.
