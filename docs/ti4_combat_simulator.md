## Project Background
Twilight Imperium (TI4) is a grand strategy board game known for its intricate diplomacy, expansive empire-building, and epic space battles. TI4's combat involves a blend of strategic planning and randomness. While unit statistics and player decisions play a significant role, the combat system incorporates elements of randomness through dice rolls.

## Project Overview
This combat simulator for TI4 utilizes Monte Carlo and probability theory to model the distribution of outcomes for in-game combat scenarios. This tool helps players understand the potential outcomes of their strategic decisions in combat, aiding in planning and execution during gameplay.

## Key Features
- Monte Carlo simulation methods to predict combat outcomes.
- Probability theory to sample from combinations of probabilities.
