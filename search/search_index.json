This function orchestrates the simulation process by calling the appropriate functions to simulate combat, calculate outcome probabilities, and plot the probabilities in a bar plot. Parameters: - initial_side_a (SideType): The initial state of side A. - initial_side_b (SideType): The initial state of side B. - num_simulations (int): The number of simulations to run for estimating outcomes. The function does not return a value but generates and saves a plot visualizing the probability of different outcomes based on the simulations. \"\"\"","title":"plot_and_simulate_data"},{"location":"ti4_combat_simulator/#example-usage","text":"The following is an example of 2 dreadnaughts, each with 2 health hitting 60% of the time fighting vs 6 fighters, each with 1 health hitting 20% of the time. initial_side_a = {(2, 0.6): 3} initial_side_b = {(1, 0.2): 6} num_simulations = 10000 plot_and_simulate_data(initial_side_a,initial_side_b,num_simulations) Experience | Education | Skills | Projects TI4 Combat Simulator | Baseball Pitch Predictor | Probabalistic Programming Tools | Data Tools","title":"Example Usage"}]}
